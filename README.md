## Project Description
The **Flight Scheduling System** is a database-driven project designed to manage flight schedules, seat bookings, and cancellations effectively. The system ensures accurate tracking of seat availability, dynamic seat allocation, and maintains consistency in scheduling operations. 

The system leverages **SQL** and **PL/SQL** to handle complex database operations, ensuring data accuracy and streamlined management of flights and bookings.

## Features
- **Flight Scheduling Management**: 
  - Efficiently handles flight scheduling, ensuring no overlapping of flight times.
- **Seat Allocation System**: 
  - Implements PL/SQL procedures to dynamically allocate seats based on availability.
- **Booking and Cancellation Management**: 
  - Tracks real-time seat availability and updates automatically upon booking or cancellation.
- **Flight Occupancy Analysis**: 
  - SQL queries to identify popular routes and trends in flight occupancy.
- **Data Integrity Constraints**: 
  - Enforces rules to ensure valid and consistent scheduling.

---

## Technologies Used
- **SQL** (Structured Query Language): 
  - For database querying and management.
- **PL/SQL** (Procedural Language/SQL): 
  - For stored procedures, triggers, and dynamic seat allocation.

## Key Database Tasks
1. **Dynamic Seat Allocation**:
   - PL/SQL procedures to assign seats based on real-time availability.
2. **Identify Popular Routes and Trends**:
   - SQL queries to generate insights into high-demand routes and flight occupancy.
3. **Ensure Valid Scheduling**:
   - Constraints to prevent overlapping schedules and maintain data consistency.

## How to Run the System
1. Set up an Oracle Database with the required schema and tables.
2. Load the provided SQL scripts for creating triggers, procedures, and constraints.
3. Use a SQL client to interact with the database for managing flight schedules, bookings, and cancellations.
4. Execute queries to analyze data and test system functionalities as per project requirements.
